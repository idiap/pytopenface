# Model

`openface-nocuda.pth` is the PyTorch version made by thnkim (see
https://github.com/thnkim/OpenFacePytorch) from the original lua
model. The file was then made cpu-friendly for loading time.

The original model comes from this
[repository](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/openface) by B. Amos,
B. Ludwiczuk, M. Satyanarayanan under Apache 2.0 license.
